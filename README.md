# Python project

The Iris dataset, first introduced by the British statistician and biologist **Ronald A. Fisher (1936)**, is one of the most widely used benchmark datasets in statistics, machine learning, and pattern recognition. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers, equally divided among three species: _Iris-setosa_, _Iris-versicolor_, and _Iris-virginica_. Each observation is described by four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In this project, I will explore the Iris dataset using **Python** through:

- **Basic Data Analysis** – calculating summary statistics (mean, variance, correlation) and visualizing feature distributions.

- **Data Visualization** – using histograms and pairwise comparisons to identify relationships between features.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – applying linear algebra techniques to reduce the dataset from four dimensions to two, while retaining as much variance as possible. This provides insight into how PCA can uncover hidden structure and simplify data visualization.
